description: Orchestrate code generation through Codex with mandatory tests.
---

Rules:
- prefer incremental edits,
- keep config machine-readable,
- preserve SecretRef credential objects,
- avoid writing plaintext secrets.
- treat any behavior mutation (including cron payload/prompt/config edits) as code/config work.
- this skill is intended for generic code/config mutations. Do NOT use this skill for generating entirely new agents (use `factory-create-agent` for that).
- when calling Codex include exact instruction: `Write Unit Tests & Verify, make changes in case of failures and revalidate. Repeat until success.`.
- preferred invocation path for code work: use `sessions_spawn` (Codex model) with prompt containing `Write Unit Tests & Verify`.
- fallback invocation path: run `codex exec` through `exec`.
- before Codex delegation, detect current provider/model context from root `openclaw.json` and keep generated model config aligned with it.
- do not run mutating tools before the first successful Codex delegation.
- record the exact `codex exec` command and exit code in the handoff report.
- always generate a companion test file for every new tool (for example `tools/my-tool.test.js`).
- after every codex invocation, execute generated/affected tests immediately.
- if test fails, run codex again with a fix prompt and rerun tests until green before handoff.
- include codex command + codex exit code + test command output + pass/fail status in the final report to CTO.
- if Codex delegation was skipped, mark task `BLOCKED: PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.
- do not run broad host diagnostics by default (`find /Users`, `env | grep token|secret`) for regular coding tasks.

Restriction:
- you are forbidden from direct `write`, `edit`, or `apply_patch` implementation of `.js`, `.ts`, or `.py` logic.
- direct file writes are allowed for `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, and `.md` (config/docs) only.

Procedure for code tasks:
1. Prepare implementation brief for Codex (scope, files, acceptance criteria). Be sure to explicitly point Codex to the ROOT project directory.
2. Add provider/model context from current `openclaw.json` and state whether provider switch is allowed.
3. Delegate via `sessions_spawn` and include exact line: `Write Unit Tests & Verify`.
4. If `sessions_spawn` is unavailable, run fallback `exec` + `codex exec`. Ensure the `--cd` argument strictly points to the ROOT project location.
5. Apply Codex-produced output.
6. If `openclaw.json` was modified, IMMEDIATELY run `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=<path_to_openclaw.json> openclaw config validate --json`. If validation fails, capture the errors and delegate a fix back to Codex before proceeding.
7. Run deterministic tests immediately.
8. If tests fail, delegate a fix to Codex and rerun tests until green.
9. Report evidence: delegation method, command/call id, exit code, test commands, test exit codes, and `openclaw.json` validation results.
